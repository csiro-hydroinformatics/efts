Title: High-Level Functions to Read and Write Ensemble Forecast Time Series in netCDF
Description: The binary file format netCDF is developed primarily for climate, ocean and
    meteorological data, and efts is a package to read and write Ensemble Forecast Time 
    Series data in netCDF. netCDF has traditionally been used to store time slices 
    of gridded data, rather than complete time series of point data. 
    efts facilitates data handling stored in netCDF files that follow a convention
    devised in the domain of ensemble hydrologic forecasting, but possibly applicable 
    in other domains. efts uses reference class objects to access data, 
    hiding the low-level and bug prone netCDF and date-time operations.
