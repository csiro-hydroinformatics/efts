Title: High-Level Functions to Read and Write Ensemble Forecast Time Series in netCDF
Description: The binary file format 'netCDF' is developed primarily for climate, ocean and
    meteorological data, and 'efts' is a package to read and write Ensemble Forecast Time 
    Series data in 'netCDF'. 'netCDF' has traditionally been used to store time slices 
    of gridded data, rather than complete time series of point data. 
    'efts' facilitates data handling stored in 'netCDF' files that follow a convention
    devised in the domain of ensemble hydrologic forecasting, but possibly applicable 
    in other domains. 'efts' uses reference class objects to 
    provide a high level interface to read and write such data, wrapping 
    lower level operations performed using 'ncdf4'.
